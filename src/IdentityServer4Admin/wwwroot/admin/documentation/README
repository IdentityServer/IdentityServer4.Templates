# IdentityServer.com & Product Mkdocs Themes
Documentation theme to fit both identityserver.com and associated products.

## Requirements
- Node 8.11+
- Gulp 4.0+
- Python 2.7+
- Pip 1.5+

## Setup
Make sure you meet the requirements and that Python is added to your `PATH` if on Windows.

Move the following files from the theme directory and into your root mkdocs directory:
- .gitignore (or merge with your own)
- gulpfile.js
- MANIFEST.ini
- mydocs.yml (or merge with your own, use as a base)
- package.json
- package-lock.json


Install MkDocs locally on your system via Pip:

`pip install mkdocs`

Now pull this repo and navigate to it in a terminal.

To serve the docs locally, run:

`mkdocs serve`

This will serve the documentation locally at http://127.0.0.1:8000

## Building

Building for distribution is easy. Navigate to the documentation directory, and run:

`npm install`

To install all dependencies.

Set the environment variable `MKDOCS_IDENTITYSERVER_THEME_COLOUR_MODE` to a valid colour mode, or `default`.

Then run `gulp build` to run the mkdocs build process and run a css purge.

The output from this will be stored in a directory called `site`.
